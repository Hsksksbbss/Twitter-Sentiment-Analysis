Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing sentiments (Positive / Negative / Neutral) from tweets using Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches.

📌 Project Overview

Preprocessed Twitter data (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal).

Built models to classify tweet sentiments.

Compared performance of a Decision Tree and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

🧪 Models & Accuracy

🌳 Decision Tree Classifier → 49% accuracy

🧠 CNN Model → 89.54% accuracy

👉 The results show that deep learning (CNN) performs significantly better than traditional ML (Decision Tree) for text sentiment analysis.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Python

Scikit-learn

TensorFlow / Keras

NLTK / Text Preprocessing libraries

🚀 Future Improvements

Try LSTM / Bi-LSTM for sequential text data

Use pre-trained embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT)

Optimize hyperparameters for better accuracy
